Rishikesh is taking his AP Physics test and he needs help with a problem on it.
<br><br>
There is an atom with a bunch of electrons, each with distinct $x$ and $y$ coordinates. The flux of a quadrilateral is defined to be the number of electrons inside of it. Find the sum of flux of every convex quadrilateral whose corners are all electrons.
<br><br>
Particles on the edge of a quadrilateral do not count.
<h3>Input</h3>
The first line is an integer $N$ $(5 \le N \le 150)$.
<br><br>
The next $N$ lines are 2 integers $x$, $y$ $(-10^4 \le x,y \le 10^4)$. All coordinates are guaranteed to be distinct.
<h3>Output</h3>
Output 1 integer, the sum of flux of every quadruplet of electrons.<br><br>

<h3>Note</h3>
Consider the following quadrilateral:
<br><br>
$(17,-58)$<br>
$(37,81)$<br>
$(8,79)$<br>
$(-16,-58)$
<br><br>
It contains two points $(30,36)$ and $(3,-4)$. The sum of all these counts for every quadrilateral is $111$.
