Rishikesh is trying to complete a geometry project! He has to draw a right triangle and write an analysis on the same paper. He wants to minimize the size of the analysis, so he decides to make the triangle take up as much space as possible.
<br><br>
Given the lengths of the two legs of the right triangle, find its area.
<h3>Input</h3>
The first and only line of input contains $l$ and $w$ $(1 \le l, w \le 10^3)$.
<h3>Output</h3>
Print a single number: the area of the right triangle.
