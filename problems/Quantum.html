Vikram is getting his PhD in quantum computing and for his final experiment, he has built an undirected graph of $N$ nodes and $M$ edges connecting them.
<br><br>
There are also $E$ electrons in nodes in the graph. At every point of time, each electron has an equal probability to go to each of its adjacent nodes. An electron must move each turn. It is possible that multiple electrons are in the same node.
<br><br>
After $T$ time, find the expected number of electrons in each node.
<h3>Input</h3>
The first line contains 4 integers, $N$, $M$, $E$, and $T$ $(1 \le N \le 100,1 \le M \le \frac{N(N-1)}{2},1 \le E \le 10^5,1 \le T \le 10^{12})$.
<br><br>
The next $M$ lines each contain two integers, $a$ and $b$ $(1 \le a,b \le N, a \neq b)$, the edges of the graph. The graph does not have multi-edges or self-loops.
<br><br>
The next line contains $E$ integers $p_1,p_2,\dots p_E$, the position of each electron $(1 \le p_i \le N)$.
<h3>Output</h3>
Let the probability be a fraction $\frac{p}{q}$. Output an integer $k$ such that $q*k = p \bmod 10^9+7$
