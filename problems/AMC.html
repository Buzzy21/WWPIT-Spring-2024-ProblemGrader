The American Mathematics Competitions (AMC) just had their test leaked! The test consists of $M$ questions that all have different answers.
<br><br>
Fortunately, each cheater was given a permutation of the answers, so they only get as many correct as the number of question answers in their permutation that match up with the real question order. For example, if the question order is $[1, 3, 2]$ and a cheater is given the permutation $[3, 1, 2]$, they would only get question $3$ correct, scoring $1$ point.
<br><br>
There are $N$ cheaters, each with a not necessarily distinct permutation of answers. AMC wants to change the order of their questions to minimize the total sum of scores that the cheaters get.
<br><br>
Calculate the minimum possible sum of scores the cheaters can get if AMC can change the order of questions. Also, print a valid ordering of questions that minimizes the sum of the scores of the cheaters. If there are multiple answers, print any.
<h3>Input</h3>
The first line is 2 integers $N$, $M$, $(1 \le N \le 10^5, 1 \le M \le 22)$, the number of cheaters and questions on the test
<br><br>
The next $N$ lines each contain $M$ integers, the permutation of answers that were given to this specific cheater.
<h3>Output</h3>
Print 2 lines. The first line is the minimum total score that the cheaters will get. The second line should contain $M$ integers, a permutation of questions to minimize the total cheater sum.

<b>Sample Input</b><br>
<codeblock>3 3
1 2 3
2 1 3
1 3 2</codeblock>
<br><b>Sample Output</b><br>
<codeblock>1
3 2 1</codeblock>
<h3>Note</h3>
If the permutation of questions $[3, 2, 1]$ is given, only the first cheater will get a point on the second question, obtaining the minimum possible sum of $1$.
