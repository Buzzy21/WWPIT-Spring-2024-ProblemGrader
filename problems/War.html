Rishikesh and Arav have been fighting each other for the last $4$ hours. They have finally decided, at last, to settle the war with a series of battles, from soldiers from their armies.
<br><br>
Rishikesh has armies of $N$ soldiers, each with a value of $v_i$. Every battle, he will choose exactly $k$ soldiers from a range $v_l,v_{l+1},...,v_{r-1},v_r$ to fight. Since he wants to win the battle, he will choose the $k$ soldiers with maximum strength, where the strength of a group of soldiers is defined by the bitwise AND of all their values.
<br><br>
Find the maximum strength of a subset for each of $B$ battles to help Rishikesh defeat Arav.
<br><br>
<h3>Input</h3>
<br>
The first line contains two integers $N$ and $B$ $(1 \le N,B \le 10^5)$.
<br><br>
The next line is $N$ integers $v_1,v_2,...,v_N$ $(0 \le v_i \le 10^5)$, the values of the soldiers.
<br><br>
The next $B$ lines are the battles, each in the form of $l$ $r$ $k$, representing a subsequence of $k$ soldiers from $v_l,v_{l+1},...,v_{r-1},v_r$ are going to the battle $(1 \le l \le r \le N, 1 \le k \le r-l+1)$.
<h3>Output</h3>
For each of the $B$ battles, find the maximum value of a subset of $k$ soldiers from the given range.

<h3>Note</h3>
Denote $\&$ as the bitwise AND operation.
<br>
Battle 1: $9\&12\&10=8$
<br>
Battle 2: $1\&5\&9\&19\&3=1$
<br>
Battle 3: $9\&12\&10=8$
<br>
Battle 4: $12\&10=8$
<br>
Battle 5: $19=19$
<br>
It can be proven that all of these are the optimal answers.
<br>
<br>
Subtask 1: $N,B,v_i \le 10^3$
<br>
Subtask 2: $N,B,v_i \le 5\cdot 10^4$
<br>
Subtask 3: No additional constraints
