Jie just turned $16$ and is now old enough to drive. In his driving test, there are $N$ turns. Each turn in his test has a max speed of $x_i$. If he exceeds $x_i$, his car will fly into the mud and have to be pulled out by a Ford F-150. He also has a minimum speed of $1$.
<br><br>
If the speed of Jie's car at a specific turn is $v \le x_i$, it takes him $\frac{1}{v}$ time to pass through the turn. Due to the acceleration and deceleration limits on the car, the speed of his next turn must be in the range $[v-d,v+a]$.
<br><br>
Find the minimum amount of time it will take for Jie to pass his driving test.
<br><br>
Note that you start at speed $0$ before the first time point.
<h3>Input</h3>
The first line is 3 integers, $N$, $a$, $d$ $(1 \le N \le 10^5, 1 \le a,d \le 10^5)$
The next line will contain $x_1,x_2,...,x_n$, the max speed of his car at the time point $(1 \le x_i \le 10^5)$
<h3>Output</h3>
The first line will contain 1 number, the minimum amount of time to complete the test. Answers within $10^{-4}$ of the jury's answer will be accepted.

<b>Sample Input</b><br>
<codeblock>5 6 2
1 10 1 10 1</codeblock>
<b>Sample Output</b><br>
<codeblock>3.666667</codeblock>
<h3>Note</h3>
Jie will accelerate to speed $1$ for the start time point, accelerate to $3$, decelerate to $1$, accelerate to $3$, and decelerate to $1$ for the end time point.
<br><br>
$\frac{1}{1}+\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{1}+\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{1}=\frac{11}{3} \approx 3.666667$
