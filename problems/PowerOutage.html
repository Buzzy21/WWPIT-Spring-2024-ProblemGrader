On Clarksville Road, there are $N$ houses, labeled $1\dots N$. The snowstorm just created a huge power outage and now they need the backup power.
<br><br>
There are $M$ backup power supplies. Each power supply will supply power to all houses $h$ in satisfying $(l \le h \le r)$ for a cost of $c$. If a house gets power from more than $1$ power supply, it overheats and explodes, killing the entire road.
<br><br>
Find the minimum cost to give power to all houses on the road. If it is not possible, output $-1$.
<h3>Input</h3>
The first contains is 2 integers, $N$ and $M$ $(1 \le N \le 10^5, 1 \le M \le 10^5)$.
<br>
The next $M$ lines contain 3 integers $l$, $r$, $c$, meaning that the cost to turn on all houses $h$
$(l \le h \le r)$ is $c$ $(1 \le l \le r \le N)$ $1 \le c \le 10^9$.
<h3>Output</h3>
The first line should contain one integer, the minimum cost to give power to all houses. If it is not possible, output $-1$.

5 10 3
6 10 10</codeblock>
<b>Sample Output</b><br>
<codeblock>12
</codeblock>
<h3>Note</h3>
Note that we cannot turn on both power supplies $1$ and $2$ because house $5$ would explode.
