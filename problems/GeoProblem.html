You have a circle divided into $N$ equally-sized sectors (like cutting a pizza). Each sector has a counter $c_i$, which initially starts at $0$.
<br><br>
In a single operation, you can draw a line through the circle, and each sector the line passes through the <b>interior</b> of gets their counter incremented by $1$.
<br><br>
What is the minimum number of operations to make the counters of all sectors equal to exactly $K$?
<h3>Input</h3>
The first line of input contains a single integer $T$ ($1 \le T \le 10^6$) - the number of independent test cases.<br><br>
The next $T$ lines of input each contain $N$ and $K$ ($1 \le N, K \le 10^9$) - the number of sectors and the desired counter respectively.

<h3>Output</h3>
For each test case, print a single integer on a new line - the minimum number of operations to make the counters of all sectors equal to $K$.

<h3>Note</h3>
For the third sub-test case, we can draw one line going through sectors $1$ and $3$, and one line going through sectors $2$ and $4$.<br><br>
