Wiley, a wise, well-paid white-collar worker, wastes his work week writing worthless wemails. 
<br><br>
For each $0 \le i \le N-1$, it takes him $a_i$ minutes to write $2^i$ emails, but it also takes $b_i$ minutes to delete $2^i$ emails. For each $0 \le k \le N-1$, what is the minimum number of minutes Wiley can use to write exactly $2^k$ emails?
<br><br>
<h3>Input</h3>
The first line of input contains $N$ ($1 \le N \le 2 \cdot 10^5$).<br>
The second line of input contains the integers $a_i$ $(1 \le a_i \le 10^9)$.<br>
The third line of input contains the integers $b_i$ $(1 \le b_i \le 10^9)$.
<h3>Output</h3>
Print a space separated list of $N$ integers: The minimum number of minutes Wiley can use to write $2^k$ emails for all $k$ satisfying $0 \le k \le N-1$.

4 2 1
1 1 1</codeblock>
<b>Sample Output</b><br>
<codeblock>3 2 1</codeblock>
<h3>Note</h3>
The optimal solution for $k=0$ is to write $2^1$ emails, taking $2$ time, then deleting $2^0$ emails, taking $1$ time.<br><br>
